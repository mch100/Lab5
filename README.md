We will have a user input their name, then a prompt will ask them is they like cats or dogs. If they select dogs, then the code will print "dogs are your favorite pets." and if they select cats it will output "cats are your favorite pets."

This code shows the if statement that tests it the user inputs a D, which signifies they like dogs, or a c, which tells the program the user likes cats.
